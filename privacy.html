As far as possible, we are committed to handling Personal Information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles regarding collection, use, and retention of Personal Information and notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.
                        </p>

                        <h3>NOTICE:</h3>
                        <p>
                            We shall inform you about the purpose(s) for which it collects and uses your Personal Information, how to contact us with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses the information, and the choices and means, if any, <strong class="theme-color">Younite</strong>  offers you for limiting its use and disclosure in clear and conspicuous language when you are first asked to provide Personal Information to us or as soon thereafter as is practicable, but in any event before we use such information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or processed by <strong class="theme-color">Younite</strong>  or discloses it for the first time to a third party.
                        </p>

                            We shall offer you the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether your Personal Information is (a) to be disclosed to a third party or (b) to be used for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You shall be provided with clear and conspicuous, readily available, and affordable mechanisms to exercise choice.
                        </p>

                        <!-- Add other principles as needed -->

                        <h3>SECURITY:</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong class="theme-color">Younite</strong>, while maintaining, using or disseminating Personal Information, shall take reasonable precautions to protect it from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

                        <h2>Why Does <strong class="theme-color">Younite</strong>  collect Personal Information?</h2>

                        <p>
                            We collect your Personal Information because it helps us deliver a superior level of service. It enables us to provide you with software support, to configure cloud-based software services that you may have ordered, and to process payments for products and services.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We process your Personal Information for legitimate business purposes, to meet our legal obligations, to fulfill contractual or pre-contractual obligations, or when you have given us your consent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Legitimate business purposes include some or all of the following: where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalize or otherwise improve our services and communications for the benefit of our customers; to identify and prevent fraud; to enhance the security of our network and information systems; to better understand how people interact with our Products; to provide communications which we think will be of interest to you; to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Whenever we process data for these purposes we will ensure that we always keep your privacy rights in high regard and take account of these rights. You have the right to object to this processing if you wish, and if you wish to do so please contact <a href="mailto:[privacy@younite.one]">[privacy@younite.one]</a>. Please bear in mind that if you object this may affect our ability to carry out some tasks for your benefit.

                        <h3>Log Files</h3>

                        <p>
                            As is true of most Products, when you use the Products, we gather certain information automatically and store it in a log file. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) address, top level domain name (for example .com, etc.), date and time of visit to the site, Internet Service Provider (ISP), type of browser used, web pages accessed, and documents downloaded.

                        <h4>Collecting Your Information through Cookies</h4>

                        <p>
                            Cookies are small files applied to your internet browser to track your Website/App movements. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to monitor Website/App usage. Cookies may be linked to a database that stores information regarding what pages you have viewed and links you have clicked. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your computer. Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, either by providing your email during a Live Chat, registering for an account, or filling out a web form, or have previously identified yourself to us, you remain anonymous.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level or directly on our Website/App, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions of our Website/App. To control cookies directly on our Website/App, click on the “Privacy Settings” link in the footer of our webpage.

                            We also use cookies in conjunction with Google's AdWords Remarketing service. Google will use your cookie information to serve interest-based advertising to you.

                        <h4>Cookie List</h4>

                        <p>
                        A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a Website/App – when visited by a user – asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as your language preference or login information. Those cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use third-party cookies – which are cookies from a domain different than the domain of the Website/App you are visiting – for our advertising and marketing efforts. More specifically, we use cookies and other tracking technologies for the following purposes:
                        </p>

                        <h4>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h4>

                        <p>These cookies are necessary for the Website/App to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>
                        <h4>Performance Cookies</h4>

                        <p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.</p>

                        <h4>Targeting Cookies</h4>

                        <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>
                        <h4>Functional Cookies</h4>

                        <p>These cookies enable the Website/App to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.</p>
                        <h4>Tracking Services</h4>
